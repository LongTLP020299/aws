# Full Stack Apps on AWS Project

You have been hired as a software engineer to develop an application that will help the FBI find missing people.  The application will upload images to the FBI cloud database hosted in AWS. This will allow the FBI to run facial recognition software on the images to detect a match. You will be developing a NodeJS server and deploying it on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. 
You will build upon the application we've developed during the lessons in this course. You'll complete a REST API endpoint in a backend service that processes incoming image URLs.

## Getting Started

You can clone this repo to run the project locally, or navigate to the workspace in the Udacity course.

## Project Instructions

To complete this project, you will need to:

### Setup Node Environment

You'll need to create a new node server. Open a new terminal within the project directory and run:

1. Initialize a new project: `npm i`
2. run the development server with `npm run dev`

### Create a new endpoint in the server.ts file

The starter code has a task for you to complete an endpoint in `./src/server.ts` which uses query parameter to download an image from a public URL, filter the image, and return the result.

We've included a few helper functions to handle some of these concepts and we're importing it for you at the top of the `./src/server.ts`  file.


import { filterImageFromURL, deleteLocalFiles } from "./util/util";


### Deploying your system
Follow the process described in the course to `eb init` a new application and `eb create` a new environment to deploy your image-filter service! Don't forget you can use `eb deploy` to push changes.

## Testing

Successful URL responses should have a 200 code. Ensure that you include error codes for the scenario that someone uploads something other than an image and for other common errors.
